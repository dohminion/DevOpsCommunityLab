# DevOpsCommunityLab

### DevOps Community lab
At work, you have a known infrastructure and people to collaborate with when you have questions. 
The idea here is to showcase multiple options to create a space that has the same configuration as others to approximate sharing some of that tribal knowledge with the larger community. 

It will also allow an Integration space for all the cool articles you find online on how to create a tool on an isolated environment. 
And the ability to ask others what they did to make that article work for them. 

Choose what you want to learn and select the lab pieces needed for that path from the grid of options

You will learn about the automation to build systems, as well as end up with a lab to learn other things 



## Goals:
Understand/compare commands between tools

Exposure to different tools and finding ones that work best for you 

No one knows all the tools, so if you know one, please contribute.
Then people will have a reference on how each tool is used to get the same result.

Ability to ask others does this happen on your system?  And get answers similar to those from a coworker 

A personal sandbox to test integration of cool demos you see in a safe area

Creating a model to build to best practices quickly, that can also be followed to deploy to production.  As opposed to most demos just quickly build a lab spec and saying "Don't do this in prod"


## Stretch goals
People building to this infrastructure in the future to ease sharing information
